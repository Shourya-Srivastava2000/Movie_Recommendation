# Movie_Recommendation
Used singular value decomposition and principles of Machine Learning to create a movie recommendation system in MATLAB. On the basis of ratings given by users for previous movies the program is able to predict the rating the user will give for a new movie and therefore how much will the user like the new movie. 
The repo contains test data taken from the AMATH 301 class at the University of Washington, for Spring 2020. The SVD_test file contains code to test the program, i.e. to how that it gives accurate ratings by comparing the output of our program to known data.
